# Python-BattleShips
Python Project - Online/Offline Battleships game

This project, "BattleShips" is a project I have been working on for a quarter of a year in school. It is the final's year project in my cyber class of my school and it is worth 30% of my grade in the "Bagrot" of program engineering in israel - 2 units for the "Bagrot".

The purpose of the project is to have fun and play with friends. I had a blast time making it and experimenting with python and its various liabreris which I hadn't known before. So I hope you would like it :)

I learnt and used a few tools to make this project. tkinter, pygame, threading and more!!!.
